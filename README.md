# Stormy Weather 
 This is a weather App that prioritizes user experience and functionality enabling users to extract the core information they are looking for at a glance. 

# PROJECT OVERVIEW 
 The Drizzle Dream Team prioritizes user experience, aiming to provide a smooth and intuitive interface for users to access weather information. This focus ensures a positive interaction for everyone using the app. By offering weather data information for cities and countries worldwide, our team demonstrates flexibility and caters to a global audience. This eliminates geographical limitations and allows users from anywhere to benefit from the app's features. 

# FEATURES

# Search Bar

 The application boasts a meticulously designed search bar, empowering users to effortlessly locate weather data for any desired city. This intuitive functionality serves as the cornerstone of a seamless user experience within the app.

# The Home Page
 The home page displays the weather data based on the country/city entered by the user. This will also show the humidity, cloud and pressure level for that day as well as a five day weather forecast for the weekdays. 

# Backgroundcolor Change
 Another feature is for the background color to change based on the weatherforecast for the day. For example, if the weather is sunny the background will display the corresponding image, likewise for any other weather forecast. 

# Error feature
An error notification mechanism handles instances where an invalid or incorrect city/country is entered. This mechanism employs a subtle animation to clear the input from the search bar by shaking off the incorrect city/country, maintaining a user-friendly experience.

# UX/UI
This app is presented as user focused presenting the relevant information without cluttering the interface. This ensures a seamless user experience wuthout overwhelming the user with too much information or design.

# User Stories
As a user I want to navigate the weather app seamlessly.
As a user I want to find information on any city/country of my choice without waiting for a long loading time.
As a user I want accurate forecast information to plan my day/week around.
As a user I want simple and easy to read information, ensuring i am not overwhelmed.

This project prioritizes testing throughout to ensure an easy usage for the users through code functiinality. We did this by communicating any issues during the coding process to each other and getting on conference calls to brainstorm solutions to existing problems until they are resolved. 
Use of resources such as diffchecker and W3C Validator to fix problems in code ensured that no time was wasted unnecessarily. 

# Deployment
Our development workflow involved consistently pushing commits to the repository after completing each feature. Once a feature was finished, we would delete the corresponding branch. Deployment involved navigating to the main page of the GitHub repository, then proceeding to the settings page. There, we would locate the deploy button, select the "main" branch, and click the save button to ensure all changes were persisted. This early deployment strategy allowed us to identify and address any potential issues that might not be apparent in the preview environment, granting us time for necessary fixes before the final release.
